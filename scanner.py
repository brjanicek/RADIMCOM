"""Scanner (SCAN tab; design in data/poznamky_scan.md, steps 1–5).

It runs inside the receiver thread: Receiver._loop calls block() once per block, right after the waterfall FFT, so it
retunes without the delay of the web API. It does not step through the channels one by one: every block measures the
power of all channels in the band the dongle receives now from the fine FFT of the waterfall (wf_power, spur mask
applied when SP is on), so a whole tuner window is checked in one block (~85 ms at 1.536 MS/s). The tuner is retuned
only to reach the next window; the channels are sorted into windows of SCAN_SPAN × sample rate.

Sources: memories (ALL, FAVOURITES or a group) or a RANGE FROM / TO / STEP / MODE / BW (a grid of channels; MODE only
AM or FM: the modes a squelch can scan). FM BCAST: the broadcast band 88–108 MHz in WFM, its own algorithm (see FMBC_*):
a station is found by the power of the core of its channel and must be the local maximum of its neighbours, so the VFO
lands on the centre of the station and not on its side. VIEW
(VISIBLE BAND) is a grid over the part of the spectrum shown by the page; the tuner is not moved for it (no windows:
the spectrum and waterfall stay as they are), so only what the dongle receives now is scanned. All channels are kept in numpy arrays, so a range of
thousands of channels costs only a few ms per block.

Squelch of a channel: its own level (scan_sq of a memory), or its noise floor + a margin (scan_asq of a memory, or the
margin of the scan with AUTO SQUELCH), or else the squelch level of its mode (when that squelch is off: the noise floor
+ margin again, so a channel never stays open for good). Noise floor: a low percentile of its
own last measurements once there are FLOOR_MIN_N of them (it knows spurs, the DC spike and local noise; it learns only
while the channel is quiet), before that the noise density of the spectrum (as the auto squelch of sdr.py). All in the
units of the squelch slider (channel power, dBFS).

Also: priority channels (in the band: at once; in another window: a look every prio_s), SKIP / LOCKOUT, carrier
lockout (a channel open longer than carrier_min), activity log (data/logs/scan_YYYY-MM-DD.csv), recording of each
activity to WAV with the audio from before the signal came back, search & store (range: active frequencies into the
memory group "Scan YYYY-MM-DD").

The decoder and record fields of the memories are ignored: only frequency, mode and bandwidth are set. The decoders
of the VFO are paused while the scan runs (app.py).
