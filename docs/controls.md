# Controls

## Tuning

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Switch VFO | **VFO-A … VFO-D** button or click on an inactive (grey) display |
| Enter a frequency | click on the active VFO display, type e.g. `7100` (kHz) or `145.5` (MHz), units `k` / `M` / `Hz` also work; Enter (Esc cancels) |
| Tune by one step | ← → arrow keys, or mouse wheel over the spectrum or waterfall (step set by STEP) |
| Next memory | ↑ ↓ arrow keys recall the next memory above / below the tuned frequency, among those visible in the spectrum |
| Tune by a digit | mouse wheel over a digit of a VFO display tunes by that digit's place (1 Hz … 1 GHz); works on inactive VFOs too, without switching |
| Tune to a point | click in the spectrum or waterfall |
| Move the band | drag with the mouse in the waterfall, or in the spectrum outside the passband |
| Move the passband | drag the passband or its label in the spectrum: the spectrum stays in place and the frequency changes |
| Filter width | drag the filter edge in the spectrum |
| Band | buttons in the groups HF HAM, HF BROADCAST, VHF / UHF HAM, OTHER (FM BCAST tunes the last FM station listened to, DAB turns on DAB radio) |

Hovering over the spectrum or waterfall shows the frequency under the mouse.
The label above the passband shows the tuned frequency, and under it the demodulation and bandwidth.
Hovering over that label opens a small audio spectrum of the active VFO, up to the end of the passband (it does not depend on
the volume or MUTE). In WFM it shows the demodulated MPX signal up to 20 kHz instead, with the 19 kHz stereo pilot.
In CW mode the bubble also shows the decoded text (the last two lines), from the CW decoder if it is on, otherwise from a separate
decoder that runs only while the bubble is open; the first characters come after ~1–3 s.

If a band or memory is outside the range of the active VFO, the receiver switches by itself to a VFO that can
receive it (e.g. an HF band to the VFO with the converter).

## VFO window

Each VFO is one dark display window; a click on an inactive window or on its **VFO** key beside the S-meter selects
that VFO. The active one has a yellow rim and its key is lit (yellow underline); the key of an inactive VFO with an open
squelch gets a green underline, a transmitting one turns red.

- **Top row:** VFO-x (boxed and yellow on the active VFO, green on an inactive one with an open squelch), the name of the
  memory / band plan / satellite transponder (lit on the active VFO; a memory with its own tag colour shows its name in that colour), a red dot while recording, a red struck-through speaker
  when a decoder (ACARS, VDL2 or ISM) has muted the audio of this VFO, and the connection state as a USB icon: green = SDR running,
  blinking orange = connecting (waiting, opening the dongle, LimeSDR calibration), grey = disconnected or error
  (hover for details). A chained VFO shows CHAIN, one out of the range of its dongle owner OOR.
- **Frequency** in the middle.
- **Info row** under it (each item has a fixed place): RX / TX (red while transmitting), the filter width, the audio
  **HPF** and **LPF** with their cutoffs (lit when on), **ST** (WFM: lit with the stereo pilot, grey without it),
  **SQL** (squelch on: grey while closed, green while open) and **CONV / BYPASS**, the required position of the manual
  upconverter switch (VFOs with upconverter mode auto; BYPASS in amber).
- **Annunciators** under it, lit when on and dark when off or not used in the current mode: the mode, AGC / AGC+
  (red while AGC+ sees A/D clipping), NF, SP, ALC, AFI (blinking), ASQ, ATU, the satellite icon (frequency corrected for
  Doppler by satellite tracking) and **CUE** (click to toggle CUE for that VFO without switching).
- **RF** and **SQL** segment bars with their values (squelch only in AM/FM/WFM): drag, click or turn the mouse wheel over
  them. They work on inactive VFOs too, without switching.

## Frequency display

- Below 30 MHz in **kHz**: `7.016.500` kHz, the first dot separates thousands, the second is the decimal point.
- From 30 MHz in **MHz**: `439.475.000` MHz.
- The last three (smaller) digits are Hz.

## Function keys

- **MODE**: demodulation. **FILTER**: bandwidth for the current mode.
- **GAIN**: AGC switches automatic tuner gain on/off (manual gain with the RF GAIN slider or in SET). **AGC+** sets the tuner gain from the level of the A/D converter: as high as possible without clipping it (the tuner AGC of the R820T watches only its LNA and mixer, not the A/D). The gain flag under the display shows `+` and the gain; the AGC+ key gets a red underline while the A/D clips. With the squelch set, AGC+ makes it work as auto squelch (ASQ lights up), because a fixed level would not fit the changing gain; the slider then only turns it on / off, and ASQ pressed in this state turns the squelch off.
- **TUNE**: **ATU** (autotune) in USB, LSB and AM. With ATU on, a click on a signal in the spectrum or waterfall tunes to the clicked point (without the step grid), listens for a moment and moves the tuning onto the carrier; the key blinks while listening and the passband label shows the shift (e.g. *ATU +130 Hz*) or *no signal*. Tuning by the wheel, the arrow keys, dragging or the VFO display digits starts it too, 0.7 s after the tuning rests, when it moved by at least 150 Hz. AM: the carrier is found within a few Hz in under 1 s. SSB: the edge of the voice band goes onto the red line (the tuned frequency): the lower edge in USB, the upper one in LSB, within a few Hz after ~2 s of speech (up to 6.5 s while nobody speaks). Tuning elsewhere while listening cancels it.
- **STEP**: tuning step (10 Hz – 10 kHz). **Zoom** (1×–32×) is the bar in the top right corner of the frequency scale: − / +, a click on a cell, or the mouse wheel over it. **Waterfall speed** (WF, 1/8 – 4×) is the same bar in the top right corner of the waterfall: below 1× several rows are averaged into one line (slower, longer history), above 1× each row is drawn taller (faster); the setting is kept in the browser. **Waterfall settings**: the gear in a square above the speed bar; with the mouse over it a half transparent window opens with the **colour scheme** (Classic, Inferno, Viridis, Turbo, Ice; only new rows take the new colours), **colour range** and **colour offset**. Kept in the browser.
- **DECODE**: turns on the FT8, WEFAX, CW, RTTY, SSTV, PACKET, ACARS, VDL2, DAB or ISM decoder. The panels are in the
  **DECODERS** tab next to SPECTRUM; turning a decoder on opens it, a green dot signals a new message/image.
  Every panel has a LOG checkbox for the daily log:
  - FT8: band buttons (160 m – 10 m) and CLR.

    ![DECODERS tab with the FT8 decoder on 80 m: one 15 s cycle of decoded messages, CQ calls in green](images/decoders_ft8.png)

  - WEFAX: stations (DWD Pinneberg 3855/7880/13882.5 kHz, Northwood GYA 2618.5/4610/8040/11086.5 kHz), LPM/IOC (Auto or fixed),
    NEW and PNG; a click in the image sets that spot as the left edge. Finished images are saved to `data\wefax\`.
    **SLANT** (ppm) with **ALIGN** straightens a slanted image: click two points on a line that should be vertical; it is kept after a restart.
    **AFC VFO** (on by default): once the decoder locks, the VFO is retuned so that the signal centre is at 1900 Hz in USB, without a break in the image.
    Next to the live image a gallery of the last 12 saved images: a click opens one, × deletes it, **DEL ALL** deletes all.
  - CW: TUNE switches to CW and tunes to the detected tone, CLR clears the text. The decoder sets its own
    threshold from the measured noise floor and the level of the received marks (follows fading, a noise blanker
    removes static crashes), so it does not depend on the ALC or the volume.
  - RTTY: SHIFT, BAUD and POLARITY (Auto or fixed), CLR.

    ![RTTY decoder receiving the DWD weather broadcast: 50 Bd, 445 Hz shift and reverse polarity detected automatically](images/decoders_rtty.png)

  - SSTV: frequencies (80m–10m, ISS FM), mode selection (Auto by VIS), STOP, PNG and a gallery of recent
    images (saved to `data\sstv\`). Modes Martin M1/M2, Scottie S1/S2/DX, Robot 36/72, PD 50–290;
    AFC and slant correction are automatic. Filter at least 2.7 kHz.
  - PACKET: AX.25 at 1200 Bd AFSK (APRS 144.800 MHz, ISS 145.825 MHz) and 9600 Bd FSK/GFSK/GMSK G3RUH (satellites),
    both at once (BAUD) and independent of the mode and filter (FM is demodulated from the baseband; 9600 Bd needs at
    least 1.536 MS/s). SCRAMBLER Auto tries 9600 Bd with and without the G3RUH scrambler. AFC shows the tuning error of
    the last 9600 Bd frame. Views: FRAMES (APRS meaning in blue over the raw text, binary telemetry as hex),
    STATIONS (APRS stations with the distance and bearing from the station set in SATELLITES › SETUP) and MAP
    (OpenStreetMap); the filter field narrows both. Frames with a wrong checksum are only counted.
    Graph on the right: SPECTRUM of the signal around the tuned frequency (averaged, MAX hold; S/N, 99 % bandwidth,
    live 9600 Bd AFC as a green line) or EYE, the eye diagram in real time (9600 / 1200 Bd), with the eye opening now
    and in the last good frame, and at 9600 Bd the deviation and the live AFC.
  - ACARS (classic link, AM 2400 bit/s): channel buttons 131.525 / 131.725 / 131.825 / 136.900 MHz, CLR;
    click the registration or flight to open the ADS-B map. Plain ACARS, FANS-1/A CPDLC and ADS-C are shown
    with coloured tags.

    ![ACARS card on 131.725 MHz: ADS-C position reports with route, track and speed, and plain ACARS messages, aircraft type and position from ADS-B](images/decoders_acars_legacy.png)

  - ISM: see [ISM decoder](decoders/ism.md).
  - VDL2 (VDL Mode 2, digital): one centre button 136.500 MHz (re-centres the VFO at 2.1 MS/s; all channels of the region
    are decoded at once), EU and US region buttons, the number of channels (list in the tooltip) and frame count, CLR. Plain ACARS, CPDLC, ADS-C
    and European ATN CPDLC in one table, see [Aircraft data link](decoders/aircraft.md).
    RTL-SDR only, not supported on LimeSDR or Airspy.

- **AUDIO**:
  - S/M: WFM stereo / mono (mono = less noise on weak stations).
  - AFI: audio frequency inversion (voice inversion scrambler / descrambler) in all modes except WFM. The audio is mirrored around
    the inversion frequency (SET, AUDIO tab, 500–4000 Hz, default 1750 Hz); the same setting scrambles and descrambles. REC and the decoders get the descrambled audio.
  - NF: automatic notch filter for AM/LSB/USB, finds and removes steady tones (whistles, carriers) by ~40 dB and
    leaves speech. It also feeds the SSTV decoder, so turn it off for SSTV.
  - LPF / HPF (keys with the filter curve icon): audio low-pass and high-pass filter in all modes except DAB (36 dB per
    octave; both on = band-pass). The key shows the cutoff; change it with the mouse wheel over the key or type it in SET.
    The audio spectrum bubble darkens what they cut off. You hear and REC the filtered audio, decoders still get the full audio.
  - SP: remove spurs from local sources. A press forgets all stored spur lines of the VFO, learns the band received now
    (LEARN, ~5 s, the key blinks red) and switches the removal on (steady yellow); another press switches it off.
    Learn on a quiet band. The band-stop is set in SETTINGS, SDR DONGLE › ADVANCED.
  - ASQ: auto squelch in AM/FM/WFM. The squelch level follows the noise in the channel plus a margin (6 dB by default, SET, AUDIO tab, 2–30 dB).
    The noise is measured in the spectrum of the dongle band (the quietest 10 % of its points, converted to the channel bandwidth), so a signal in
    the channel, even a long one, does not raise the level and close it; in a crowded band (e.g. FM broadcast) the quietest channel power over the
    last 15 s is used when it is lower. The measurement starts again after a change of frequency, mode, bandwidth or gain. The SQL bar
    of the VFO window follows the level in use; so does the yellow mark on the S-meter.
  - ALC: automatic audio level in AM/LSB/USB/CW; off = fixed gain.
  - CUE: keep hearing this VFO (at the CUE level) when another VFO is selected.
- **SAT**: the satellite key switches to the SATELLITES tab and back, see [Satellite tracking](satellites.md).
- **Volume** (top right): vertical MAIN (active VFO) and CUE faders, stereo L/R level meter. Below them the speaker button
  is MUTE (green = sound on, red = muted). Under it are two recording keys for the active VFO, which work independently of each other and go on with the page closed:
  - **REC** records everything until switched off, also the silence of a closed squelch. After 15 minutes it continues in a new file.
  - **REC SQ** records only while there is audio (open squelch), each session in its own file. A session ends when the squelch stays closed for 1 s; that silence is not saved, and a burst shorter than 0.3 s is dropped. In modes without a squelch, or with the squelch off, one session runs until the key is switched off, with no length limit.

  Files go to `data\recordings` as MP3, 128 kbps, named by the frequency and mode at the start of the file and its start time: `145.500000MHz_FM_20261105_155300.mp3`. If that frequency is in the memories, the name of the memory comes first, with `_` instead of spaces: `Piestany_TWR_118.575000MHz_AM_20261105_155300.mp3`. Retuning during a recording does not start a new file; a change of the sample rate does. A key shows the time of the current file while writing, and it is lit without a time while waiting for audio. A red dot in the corner of the VFO display shows the same for each VFO: blinking while writing, steady while waiting for audio. Like the audio of the VFO, recording pauses while ACARS, VDL2 or ISM runs, and DAB is not recorded.
- **MENU → SET (gear)**: settings of the active VFO. While the gear key is lit, the bottom part has a **SETTINGS** tab
  (beside SPECTRUM, DECODERS and SATELLITES) with page keys like SATELLITES; the open page is remembered in the browser.
  The gear is one switch for all VFOs; switching it off hides the tab. The pages:
  - **SDR DONGLE**, with two sub-pages:
    - **BASIC**
      - Without `vfos.json` (single receiver) the dongle selection and the upconverter mode (auto / on / off).
      - **Bandwidth**: the width of the band the dongle receives (sample rate) = the width of the spectrum and waterfall.
      - **Correction (ppm)** and **Upconverter LO (MHz)**.
      - Tuner gain (manual or automatic) and **RTL2832 digital gain** (its digital AGC, RTL-SDR only).
      - **Remove DC peak** (on by default): removes the peak of the dongle in the centre of the band, from the waterfall and from the received signal. **Width** (up to 1000 Hz) also
        takes out its wide skirts, which LimeSDR needs, but weakens signals that close to the centre. **Suppression** (0–60 dB) sets how deep the removal goes.
      - **Bias-tee** 4.5 V (if the SDR has it). Turn it on only when the upconverter or preamplifier really needs it.
      - **RESET SDR DONGLE**: closes the dongle and opens it again with the same settings (frequency, gain, bandwidth); for a stopped spectrum or a USB error.
    - **ADVANCED**
      - **Dongles and VFOs**: every dongle from `data\vfos.json` with its serial number, the VFOs it serves (chained ones too) and its note; State ✓ when the VFO receiver has the dongle open and running
        (an error with its reason in the tooltip), connected RTL dongles without a VFO as *free*. The dongle these settings apply to is highlighted. Assignment changes need a full server restart.
      - **SP – Spurs removal**: for a switching power supply and the like. **LEARN** finds lines at a regular spacing of 12 kHz or more in the band received now, so learn on a quiet band.
        Each line gets a band-stop set by **Width**, **Edge**, **Shift** and **Depth**, which takes it down to the noise around it. Cleans the waterfall and the channel you listen to (not WFM and wide FM).
        A signal on a spur is removed with it.
      - **AGC+**: its parameters (clipping thresholds, steps down and up, the level for going up, target, hold time, settle blocks) with the gain and A/D level live; DEFAULTS returns them.
  - **AUDIO**: AFI inversion frequency, the ASQ (auto squelch) margin above the noise (2–30 dB), HPF and LPF frequency. The squelch level itself is set by the SQL bar of the VFO window.
  - **UI**, with three sub-pages:
    - **SKINS**: finish of the panel – dark brushed aluminium (default), black (darker) brushed aluminium, light brushed aluminium, mahogany or paint. A click on a colour of the RAL chart
      (36 common RAL Classic shades, screen approximations) or an own colour sprays the panel with it; on a light colour the print and the logo turn dark.
      Keys, displays and the screen stay the same. Remembered in the browser.
    - **S-METER**: calibration (S9 level, per VFO) and layout (needle, bar graph, LED bar, VFD display, amber needle, 7-segment, peak bar).
    - **TOUCHPAD**: touchpad wheel speed (1–10, default 4; left = slower), remembered in the browser for all VFOs. A mouse wheel notch is always one step.
  - **ROTOR**: the antenna rotor of this VFO. **ON / OFF** at the top left: OFF only says that the rotor configuration of the VFO is off (the link is closed);
    ON opens the link with the serial port chosen under it and shows the rest: a **polar plot** (north up, centre = zenith) and beside it an **elevation column**
    0–180° (over 90° the antenna looks back over the top). The orange cross / orange arrow is the antenna now, the green ring the requested direction (only while the rotor is on its way); beside them the actual AZ / EL (orange) and the requested AZ / EL (green). The shown position is filtered, so the ~1 % noise of the readings does not flicker. A click on the polar plot
    turns the antenna to that azimuth and elevation, a click on the column sets only the elevation (not while TRACK moves the rotor). Keys **STOP** (both motors),
    **RESET** (clears a fault, orange while there is one) and **MONITOR** (shows AZ / EL in the AD, see below; per VFO, remembered in the browser).
    Then the **azimuth calibration**. See [Satellite tracking](satellites.md).
  - **TX** (LimeSDR only): Enable TX, see [Transmitting (LimeSDR)](configuration.md#transmitting-limesdr).
- **MENU → MEM**: frequency memories. While the MEM key is lit, the bottom part has a **MEMORIES** tab (beside DECODERS,
  SATELLITES and SETTINGS) that covers the spectrum and waterfall like the other tabs; the MEM key is one switch for all VFOs,
  switching it off hides the tab, and the open page is remembered in the browser. The pages:
  - **CHANNELS**, **GROUPS**, **IMPORT**, **EXPORT**: the [memory editor](#memory-editor). CHANNELS is also the list to
    recall memories from: a click on a row selects it (Ctrl+click adds or removes rows), a double click tunes the memory
    (frequency, mode, width; a DAB memory turns DAB on with its channel, and the decoder and recording of a memory are
    switched on), and ✎ at the start of the row opens it in the form. The memory the VFO is
    tuned to is highlighted, and the table scrolls to it (the order stays) when the page opens and when the VFO moves to
    another memory.
  Memories in the visible part of the spectrum show their name on a tag at the top of the spectrum (green, or the colour
  chosen in the editor; a red ● before the name = recalling it starts a recording); click a tag to recall the memory.

- **MENU → BAND**: shows or hides the row of band keys; the spectrum and waterfall take the freed space. Remembered in the browser.

**AD (additional display)**: the dark window under the S-meter and the VFO keys shows one thing at a time, by priority:

1. **Error messages** (red), e.g. a refused setting, TX, a recording error, DAB on a dongle that cannot do it. A message stays until it is
   accepted by the small framed **OK**; the frame of the window blinks red (period 0.5 s) meanwhile. More waiting messages show *+n*, the next one comes after OK.
   (Errors used to show for 5 s under the logo.)
2. **Rotor AZ / EL** of the active VFO while **MONITOR** is on (SETTINGS, ROTOR page), with the requested direction while the rotor is on its way (or LINK OFF, NOT CONNECTED, FAULT).
3. **RDS** (station name, RadioText, PI, PTY, TP/TA); empty without RDS.

The clock (top right) switches between local time and UTC with a click. Small bars under the S-meter show the CPU load and
memory use of the PC running RADIMCOM (amber over 70 %, red over 90 %). A click on the RADIMCOM logo opens the project on GitHub. When a newer version is released, the logo turns red; hovering shows the new version and a click opens its release page in a new tab.
The page is laid out for at least 1920 × 820 px and scaled to the browser window, so the layout does not reflow in small windows.

## Memory editor

The memory editor was written by **Brano ([brjanicek](https://github.com/brjanicek))**. It is the pages **CHANNELS**, **GROUPS**, **IMPORT** and
**EXPORT** of the MEMORIES tab. Changes are saved at once (except the IMPORT and EXPORT lists).

- **CHANNELS**: every memory in a table: star, name, frequency, mode, bandwidth, decoder, record, groups, tag and note. Show one group
  or `(no group)`, search name, note, group or kHz, and click a **column header** to sort by it (again = the other way round;
  by **Groups** the table has a section per group, a channel in two groups is listed under both, with the note of the
  group). The columns have fixed widths; a text that does not fit is cut and shown whole as the tooltip. **⧉ duplicates** shows only the channels on the same
  frequency (within 50 Hz) and mode as another one; ⧉ marks them in the list too.
  A click on a row selects it (Ctrl+click adds or removes more rows), a double click recalls the channel, and ✎ at the start of the row opens it in the form on the right (✎ is hidden while more rows are selected; while the form is open the tick boxes are hidden and a click on a row opens that channel in the form). **★ only** shows only the starred channels;
  **＋ SAVE CURRENT** fills a new channel with the tuned frequency, mode and width (and DAB channel), **＋ NEW** an empty one. The form edits the name, frequency, mode,
  bandwidth, **decoder** (switched on when the channel is recalled, and its page shown in DECODERS: FT8, WEFAX, CW, RTTY,
  SSTV, PACKET, ACARS, VDL2 or ISM), **record** (a recording to MP3 started when the channel is recalled: **ON** = REC,
  everything; **SQ** = REC SQ, only while the squelch is open; **ASQ** = REC SQ with the auto squelch switched on, AM, FM
  and WFM; **OFF** = none, the default; a recording or ASQ that recalling a channel started stops when the VFO leaves
  the channel (another frequency, mode or channel); one switched on by hand, or a key pressed by hand meanwhile, stays), DAB channel, the **groups** (a list, one per line, scrolls when long: tick any number, or type a new one and press Enter),
  a **note**, the **tag in the spectrum** (shown or hidden, default shown) with its **colour** (↺ = the default green) and
  the star. It warns when another channel is on the same frequency and mode. **＋ NEW** fills it from the tuner.
  Select or tick channels for the bar above the table (with none selected, it acts on the channel open in the form): pick a group in the list (or **＋ new group…** and type its name) and add them to it (**＋ TO GROUP**, they stay in their other groups),
  remove them from it, **MOVE** them to one group only, star or unstar them, show or hide their tags, set or reset their
  colour (**SET** / **DEFAULT**), put them on the export list (**⇩ TO EXPORT**) or delete them.
- **GROUPS**: every group with the number of its channels and its **note** (saved when you leave the field). **＋ ADD GROUP**
  adds an empty group. Per group, as icons: **☰** shows its channels in CHANNELS, **✎** renames it, **⎘** copies it (a new group with copies of its
  channels, which can then be changed without touching the original) and **🗑** deletes it (asks whether the channels that are in no
  other group are deleted too, or kept without a group). Tick groups to **MERGE** them into one (asks for its name; the
  notes are joined), to delete them or to put their channels on the export list.
- **IMPORT**: **LOAD FILE…** reads one or more files and recognises their format by the content: a RADIMCOM export
  (JSON, also the older lists of 0.111 and 0.112, or CSV), SDR# `frequencies.xml`, the SDR++ frequency manager
  (`frequency_manager_config.json`, each list becomes a group), gqrx `bookmarks.csv` (tags become groups, the colour of
  the first tag the tag colour) or a CHIRP CSV (name, frequency, mode and comment as the note). Files without groups put
  their channels into a group named after the file (SDR++ / gqrx / CHIRP); the message says which format was found. The channels go to a list first,
  nothing is saved yet: edit any field there, see which are new, which are already in the memories (⧉ with the name) and which
  have an error (red, not selected). All valid channels are selected; **NEW ONLY** selects those not in the memories,
  **SET GROUP** puts the selected ones into one group. **IMPORT SELECTED** saves them; the others stay in the list, so you can
  edit and import them later. Groups of a JSON file are shown with their notes, which are imported with the channels.
- **EXPORT**: put channels on the list: a whole group (**＋ GROUP**), the starred ones, all, or ticked channels and groups from the
  other pages. Changes in the list only go into the file. Untick a channel to leave it out, and choose per channel (or for
  all in the header) whether its tag **colour**, its **tag** shown / hidden and its **note** are exported. The groups of the
  list are shown above it with their notes, each with a tick whether its note is exported. **JSON** keeps everything,
  **CSV** (`;`, UTF-8, opens in Excel) has the columns `name;frequency_hz;mode;bandwidth_hz;groups;decoder;record;dab_channel;favourite;note;color;show_tag`
  (groups separated by `|`) and is read back by IMPORT; group notes go only into JSON.

The memories are in `data\memories.json`, the groups with their notes and empty groups in `data\memory_groups.json`.
Each memory keeps its first group in the old `group` field, so older versions still read the file; before the first change
the file of the older version is copied to `memories.json.bak`.
