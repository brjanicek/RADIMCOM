# ISM decoder (433 / 868 MHz)

The **ISM** key in DECODE decodes devices on 433 and 868 MHz, such as weather sensors, remote controls and tyre sensors, via rtl_433.

ISM (433 / 868 MHz devices such as weather sensors and remote controls, decoded by [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433)): buttons 433.92 and 868.30 MHz centre the VFO, which runs at 2.048 MS/s (see Channels below). The audio of the VFO is muted, and REC records nothing. The table shows the device, ID, channel, level and data; a message the device repeats is one row with ×N. **ISM** again, **OFF** in the card or any band button ends it and restores the sample rate. While ISM is on, RTL2832 AGC and tuner AGC are on (AGC+ and Remove DC peak off); at the end the gain, RTL AGC, AGC+ and Remove DC peak from before come back. ISM turns ACARS, VDL2 and DAB off. RTL-SDR only; not on LimeSDR, Airspy or a chained VFO.

**Channels.** rtl_433 gets narrow channels of 256 kS/s that RADIMCOM cuts out of the 2.048 MS/s of the dongle, one rtl_433 each: 433.92 and 433.42 MHz at the 433.92 preset, 868.30 and 868.95 MHz (Wireless M-Bus meters, mostly encrypted) at the 868.30 preset with rtl_433's automatic level (hover the message counter). With the whole 2 MHz at once, noise and several transmitters merge into long packages and rtl_433 decodes far fewer messages (on a 5 min test recording 107 instead of 236). A device further than about ±110 kHz from a channel centre is not decoded.

**RAW** shows packages of at least 20 pulses that no decoder read, as grey rows: modulation guess, pulses, length and the demodulated bits from rtl_433's pulse analyzer; the tooltip has the flex decoder hint (`-X ...`) and **⧉** shows the pulses at triq.org/pdv. Many are noise or devices rtl_433 does not know. Packages of the same kind within ±15 kHz in 10 s are one row with ×N. RAW rows are not written to the log.

A Wireless M-Bus meter is one row for an hour with its latest message. The same message of a device within 1 min is one row with ×N, moved to the top with the time of the last one. One packet read by two decoders of rtl_433 is one row with both device names (e.g. *LaCrosse-TX29IT / LaCrosse-TX35DTHIT*). Units are SI (°C, km/h, mm).

rtl_433 is a separate program (`lib\ism\rtl_433.exe`); `ism.py` gives it the raw samples through a local rtl_tcp server and reads its messages. Licences and sources are in `installer\ISM.txt` (`lib\ism\README.txt` in the package).
